I am trying to add STL path to includePath, but doesn't work;

"includePath": [
                "${workspaceRoot}",
                "F:/code/stl"
            ]
            

You also need to set the browse.path, includePath is used when the intelliSenseEngine is set to Default
and should match the compiler, and the browse.path is the path where you want symbols to be searched

{
    "name": "Win32",
    "includePath": [
        "${workspaceRoot}",
        "F:/code/stl"
    ],
    "defines": [
        "_DEBUG",
        "UNICODE"
    ],
    "browse": {
        "path": ["F:/code/stl"],
        "limitSymbolsToIncludedHeaders": true,
        "databaseFilename": ""
    }
}
