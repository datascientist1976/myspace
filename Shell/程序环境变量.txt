1 Variables may be added to a program¡¯s environment without permanently affecting the environment of the shell or subsequent commands.
    
    ENV_VAR=XXX  ./program
        
2 The env command may be used to remove variables from a program¡¯s environment,or to temporarily change environment variable values:
    
    env -i PATH=$PATH HOME=$HOME LC_ALL=C awk '...' file1 file2

    The ¨Ci option initializes the environment; i.e.,throws away any inherited values, passing in to the program only those variables 
    named on the command line;
